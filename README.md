## Goal

Using everything that I've learned so far during the Odin Project, I am going to build a calculator using javascript, HTML and CSS.

## Things I've learned about

 - How computers and calculators parse infix equations to postfix equations (Real Polish Notation)
 - Classes within javascript and they're differences to other languages I know (i.e. private variables aren't a supported thing yet.)
 - More practice with Regex.
